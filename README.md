### Some Notes

* The book is still not finished. Several articles are missing and many finished articles need correcting.
* Translations are welcome, but for the last note, it may not be the proper time to do so.
* Chinese translation version will be transalted by myself ([@TapirLiu](https://twitter.com/tapirliu)).
* A more relexed license is coming soon.
