<h1>Type Embedding</h1>

<p>
From <a href="struct.html">this article</a>, we know that a struct type can have many fields.
Each of the fields is composed of one field name and one field type.
In fact, sometimes, a struct field can be composed of one field type only.
Such fields are called anonymous fields in Go.
An anonymous field is also called a type embedding.
</p>

<p>
This article will explain the intention of type embedding and all kinds of details in type embedding.
</p>

<h3>What Does Type Embedding Look Like?</h3>

<div>
Here is an example of type embedding:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type S = []int
	var x struct {
		string // a defined non-pointer type
		error  // a defined interface type
		*int   // an unnamed pointer type
		S      // an alias of an unnamed pointer type
		
	}
	x.string = "Go"
	x.error = nil
	x.int = new(int)
	x.S = []int{}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In the above example, four types are embedded in the struct type.
Each type embedding forms an anonymous field.
</p>

In fact, each anonymous field has an implicit name.
The unqualified type names of the four anonymous fields are their names.
For example, the names of the four anonymous fields in the above examples are
<code>string</code>, <code>int</code>m <code>error</code>,
and <code>S</code>, respectively.
</div>

<h3>Which Types Can be Embedded?</h3>

<div>
The following types can't be embedded:
<ul>
<li>
	defined pointer types.
</li>
<li>
	unnamed types, except unnamed one-level pointer types
	whose base types are non-interface and non-poiner defined types.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other types can be embedded.
</p>

Following lists some types can and can't be embedded:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type Encoder interface {Encode([]byte) []byte}
type Person struct {name string; age int}
type Alias = struct {name string; age int}
type AliasPtr = *struct {name string; age int}
type IntPtr *int

// These types can be embedded in a struct type.
Encoder
Person
*Person
Alias
*Alias
AliasPtr
int
*int

// These types can't be embedded.
*Encoder         // base type is an interface type
*AliasPtr        // base type is a pointer type
IntPtr           // defined pointer type
*IntPtr          // base type is a pointer type
struct {age int} // unnamed type
map[string]int   // unnamed type
[]int64          // unnamed type
func()           // unnamed type
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
No two fields are allowed to have the same name in a struct,
there are not exceptions for annonymous struct fields.
By the anonymous field implicitly naming rules,
an unnamed pointer type can't be embedded along with its base type
in the same struct type.
For example, <code>int</code> and <code>*int</code> can't be embedded
in a struct type at the same time.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Generally, it is only meaningful to embed types who have fields or methods.
The following sections will explain why.
</p>

<h3>What Is The Meaningfulness Of Type Embedding?</h3>

<div>
<p>
The main purpose of type embedding is to extend the functionalities of the embedded types
into the embedding type, so that we don't need to reimplement
the functionalities of the embeded types for the embedding type.
</p>

Many other object-oriented programming languages use inheritance
to achieve the same goal of type embedding.
Both mechanisms have their own
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance">benefits and drawbacks</a>.
Here, this article will not discuss which one is better.
We should just know Go chose the type embedding mechanism,
and there is a big difference between the two:
<ul>
<li>
	If a type <code>T</code> inherits another type,
	then type <code>T</code> obtains the abilities of the other type.
	At the same time, each value of type <code>T</code> can also be
	viewed as a value of the other type.
</li>
<li>
	If a type <code>T</code> embeds another type,
	then type other type becomes a part of type <code>T</code>,
	and type <code>T</code> obtains the abilities of the other type,
	but none values of type <code>T</code> can be viewed as values of the other type.
</li>
</ul>

Here is an example to show how an embedding type extends
the functionalities of the embedded types.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}
func (p Person) PrintName() {
	fmt.Println("Name:", p.Name)
}
func (p *Person) SetAge(age int) {
	p.Age = age
}

type Singer struct {
	Person // extends Person by embedding it
	works  []string
}

func main() {
	var gaga = Singer{Person: Person{"Gaga", 30}}
	gaga.PrintName() // Name: Gaga
	gaga.Name = "Lady Gaga"
	(&gaga).SetAge(31)
	(&gaga).PrintName()   // Name: Lady Gaga
	fmt.Println(gaga.Age) // 31
}
</code></pre>

<p>
From the above example, it looks that after embedding type <code>Person</code>,
the type <code>Singer</code> obtains (inherits) all methods and fields of type <code>Person</code>,
and type <code>*Singer</code> obtains (inherits) all methods of type <code>*Person</code>.
Are the conclusions right? The following sections will answer this question.
</p>

Please note that, a <code>Singer</code> value is not a <code>Person</code> value,
the following code doesn't compile:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var gaga = Singer{}
var _ Person = gaga
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Does The Embedding Type Obtain The Fields Of The Embedded Types?</h3>

<div>
Let's list all the fields and methods of type <code>Singer</code>
and the methods of  type <code>*Singer</code>
used in the last example by using reflection
functionalities provided by the <code>reflect</code> standard package:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">...
import "reflect"
...
func main() {
	t := reflect.TypeOf(Singer{}) // the Singer type
	fmt.Println(t, "has", t.NumField(), "fields:")
	for i := 0; i < t.NumField(); i++ {
		fmt.Print("   filed#", i, ": ", t.Field(i).Name, "\n")
	}
	fmt.Println(t, "has", t.NumMethod(), "methods:")
	for i := 0; i < t.NumMethod(); i++ {
		fmt.Print("   method#", i, ": ", t.Method(i).Name, "\n")
	}
	
	pt := reflect.TypeOf(&Singer{}) // the *Singer type
	fmt.Println(t, "has", pt.NumMethod(), "methods:")
	for i := 0; i < pt.NumMethod(); i++ {
		fmt.Print("   method#", i, ": ", pt.Method(i).Name, "\n")
	}
}
</code></pre>

The result:
<pre class="output"><code>main.Singer has 2 fields:
   filed#0: Person
   filed#1: works
main.Singer has 1 methods:
   method#0: PrintName
main.Singer has 2 methods:
   method#0: PrintName
   method#1: SetAge
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
From the result, we know that the type <code>Singer</code> really owns
a <code>PrintName</code> method, and the type <code>*Singer</code> really
owns two methods, <code>PrintName</code> and <code>SetAge</code>.
But the type <code>Singer</code>doesn't own a <code>Name</code> field.
Then why is the selector expression <code>gaga.Name</code>
legal for a <code>Singer</code> value <code>gaga</code>?
Please read the next section to get the reason.
</p>

<h3>Shorthands Of Selectors</h3>

<p>
From the articles <a href="struct.html">structs in Go</a> and
<a href="method.html">methods in Go</a>, we have learned that,
for a value <code>x</code>, <code>x.y</code> is called a selector,
where <code>y</code> is either a field name or a method name.
If <code>y</code> is a field name,
then <code>x</code> must be a struct value or a struct pointer value.
A selector is an expresssion, which represents a value.
If the selector <code>x.y</code> denotes a field, it may also
has its own fields (if <code>x.y</code> is a struct value) and methods.
Such as <code>x.y.z</code>,
where <code>z</code> can also be either a field name or a method name.
</p>

<p>
There is a syntax sugar in Go, (without considering selector colliding and
shadowing explained in a later section), <b><i>if a middle name in a seletor
corresponds to an embedded field, then that name can be omitted from the selector</i></b>.
This is why embedded types are called anonymous fields.
</p>

<div>
For example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

type A struct {
	x int
}
func (a A) MethodA() {}

type B struct {
	A
}
type C struct {
	B
}
	
func main() {
	var c C
	
	// The following 4 lines are equivalent.
	_ = c.B.A.x
	_ = c.B.x
	_ = c.A.x
	_ = c.x
	
	// The following 4 lines are equivalent.
	c.B.A.MethodA()
	c.B.MethodA()
	c.A.MethodA()
	c.MethodA()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This is why the expression <code>gaga.Name</code> is legal
in the example in the last section.
For it is just the shorthand of <code>gaga.Person.Name</code>.
</p>

As any embedding type must be a struct type,
the article <a href="struct.html">structs in Go</a>
has mentioned that the field of an addressable struct value
can be accessed through the pointers of the struct value.
So the following code is also legal in Go.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func main() {
	var c C
	pc = &c
	
	// The following 4 lines are equivalent.
	fmt.Println(pc.B.A.x)
	fmt.Println(pc.B.x)
	fmt.Println(pc.A.x)
	fmt.Println(pc.x)
	
	// The following 4 lines are equivalent.
	pc.B.A.MethodA()
	pc.B.MethodA()
	pc.A.MethodA()
	pc.MethodA()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Similiarly, the selector <code>gaga.PrintName</code> can be viewed as
a shorthand of <code>gaga.Person.PrintName</code>.
But, it is also okay if we think it is not a shorthand.
After all, the type <code>Singer</code> really has a <code>PrintName</code>
method, though the method is declared implicitly
(please read the next next section for details).
For the similar reason, the selector <code>(&gaga).PrintName</code>
and <code>(&gaga).SetAge</code> can also be viewed as, or not as,
shorthands of <code>(&gaga.Person).PrintName</code> and
<code>(&gaga.Person).SetAge</code>.
</p>

<p>
Note, we can also use the selector <code>gaga.SetAge</code>, but only if
<code>gaga</code> is an addressable value of type <code>Singer</code>.
It is just a sugar of <code>(&gaga).SetAge</code>.
Please read <a href="method.html#call">method calls</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
In the above examples, <code>c.B.A.x</code> is called the full form
of selectors <code>c.x</code>, <code>c.B.x</code> and <code>c.A.x</code>. 
Similarly, <code>c.B.A.MethodA</code> is called the full form of selectors
<code>c.MethodA</code>, <code>c.B.MethodA</code> and <code>c.A.MethodA</code>.
</p>

<p>
If every middle name in the full forl of a selector corresponds to
an anonymous field, then the number of moddile names in the selector
is called the depth of the selector.
The depths of all the selectors used in the above two examples are two.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Selector Shadowing And Colliding</h3>

<div>
For a value <code>x</code>, it is possible that many of its full-form
selectors have the same last item <code>y</code>
(which is either a explicitly declared field or method)
and every middle names of these selectors is an anonymous field name.
For such cases,
<ul>
<li>
	only the full-form selector with the shallowest depth can be shortened as <code>x.y</code>.
	In other words, <code>x.y</code> denotes the the full-form selector with the shallowest depth.
	Other full-form selectors are <b>shadowed</b> by the one with the shallowest depth.
</li>
<li>
	if there are more than one full-form selectors with the shallowest depth,
	then none of those full-form selectors can be shortened as <code>x.y</code>.
	We say those full-form selectors with the shallowest depth are <b>colliding</b>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a method selector is shadowed by another method selector,
and the two corresponding method signatures are identical,
we say the first method is overridden by the other one.
</p>

For example, assume <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>
are three defined types.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type A struct {
	x string
}
func (A) y(int) bool {
	return false
}

type B struct {
	y bool
}
func (B) x(string) {}

type C struct {
	B
}
</code></pre>

The following code doesn't compile.
The reasons is selector <code>v1.A.x</code> and <code>v1.B.x</code> are collided,
so both of them can't be shortened to <code>v1.x</code>.
The same sotuation is for selector <code>v1.A.y</code> and <code>v1.B.y</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var v1 struct {
	A
	B
}

func f1() {
	_ = v1.x
	_ = v1.y
}
</code></pre>

The following code compiles okay.
The selector <code>v2.C.B.x</code> is shadowed by <code>v2.A.x</code>, so the
selector <code>v2.x</code> is a shortened form of <code>v2.A.x</code> actually.
For the same reason, the selector <code>v2.y</code> is a shortened form of
<code>v2.A.y</code>, not of <code>v2.C.B.y</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var v2 struct {
	A
	C
}

func f2() {
	fmt.Printf("%T \n", v2.x) // string
	fmt.Printf("%T \n", v2.y) // func(int) bool
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Implicit Methods For Embedding Types</h3>

<div>

<p>
As above has mentioned, both of type <code>Singer</code> and
type <code>*Singer</code> have a <code>PrintName</code> method each.
And the type <code>*Singer</code> also has a <code>SetAge</code> method.
However, we never explicitly declare these methods
for the two types. Where do these methods come from?
</p>

In fact,
<ul>
<li>
	for each method of an embedded type,
	if the selectors to that method neither collide nor are shadowed
	by other selectors, then compilers will implicitly declare
	a correspoding method for the embedding struct type.
	And consequently, compiler will also
	<a href="method.html#implicit-pointer-methods">implicitly declare
	a correspoding method</a> for the unnamed pointer type
	whose base type is the embedding struct type.
</li>
<li>
	assume a struct type <code>S</code> embeds a named type <code>T</code>,
	for each method of type <code>*T</code>,
	if the selectors to that method neither collide nor are shadowed
	by other selectors, then compilers will implicitly declare
	a correspoding method for type <code>*S</code>.
</li>
</ul>

Simply speaking,
<ul>
<li>
	both type <code>struct{T}</code> and type <code>*struct{T}</code>
	will obtain (inherit) all the methods of type <code>T</code>.
</li>
<li>
	type <code>*struct{T}</code> will obtain (inherit)
	all the methods of type <code>*T</code> as well.
</li>
<li>
	both type <code>struct{*T}</code> and type <code>*struct{*T}</code>
	will obtain (inherit) all the methods of type <code>*T</code>.
	As the method set of type <code>T</code> is a subset of type <code>*T</code>,
	we can also say both type <code>struct{*T}</code> and <code>*struct{*T}</code>
	will obtain (inherit) all the methods of type <code>T</code>.
</li>
</ul>

Here are the implicitly declared methods for type <code>Singer</code>
and type <code>*Singer</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (s Singer) PrintName() {
	s.Person.PrintName()
}

func (s *Singer) PrintName() {
	(*s).Person.PrintName()
}

func (s *Singer) SetAge(age int) {
	(&s.Person).SetAge(age) // <=> (&((*s).Person)).SetAge(age)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
From the article <a href="method.html">methods in Go</a>,
we know that we can't explicitly declare methods for non-defined struct types
and non-defined pointer types whose base types are non-defined struct types.
But through type embedding, such non-defined types can also own methods.
</p>

Here is another example to show which implicit methods are declared.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "reflect"

type F func(int) bool
func (f F) Validate(n int) bool {
	return f(n)
}
func (f *F) Modify(f2 F) {
	*f = f2
}

type B bool
func (b B) IsTrue() bool {
	return bool(b)
}
func (pb *B) Invert() {
	*pb = !*pb
}

type I interface {
	Load()
	Save()
}

func main() {
	PrintTypeMethods := func(t reflect.Type) {
		fmt.Println(t, "has", t.NumMethod(), "methods:")
		for i := 0; i < t.NumMethod(); i++ {
			fmt.Print("   method#", i, ": ", t.Method(i).Name, "\n")
		}
	}
	
	var s struct {
		F
		*B
		I
	}
	
	PrintTypeMethods(reflect.TypeOf(s))
	fmt.Println()
	PrintTypeMethods(reflect.TypeOf(&s))
}
</code></pre>

The result:
<pre class="output"><code>struct { main.F; *main.B; main.I } has 5 methods:
   method#0: Invert
   method#1: IsTrue
   method#2: Load
   method#3: Save
   method#4: Validate

*struct { main.F; *main.B; main.I } has 6 methods:
   method#0: Invert
   method#1: IsTrue
   method#2: Load
   method#3: Modify
   method#4: Save
   method#5: Validate
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
If a struct type embeds a type which implements an interface type
(the embedded type may be the interface type itself),
then generally the struct type also implements the interface type,
exception there is a method specified by the interface type
shadowed by of colliding other methods or fileds.
</p>

Please note, a type will only obtain the methods of the types its contains
(embeds directly or indirectly).
For example, in the the following code,
<ul>
<li>
	type <code>Age</code> has no methods, for it doesn't embed any types.
</li>
<li>
	type <code>X</code> has two methods, <code>IsOdd</code> and <code>Double</code>.
	<code>IsOdd</code> is obtained through embedding type <code>MyInt</code>.
</li>
<li>
	type <code>Y</code> has no methods, for its embedded type <code>Age</code> has not methods.
</li>
<li>
	type <code>Z</code> has only one method, <code>IsOdd</code>.
	for it contains type <code>MyInt</code>.
	It doesn't obtain the method <code>Double</code> from type <code>X</code>,
	for it doesn't contain type <code>X</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type MyInt int
func (mi MyInt) IsOdd() bool {
	return mi%2 == 1
}

type Age MyInt

type X struct {
	MyInt
}
func (x X) Double() MyInt {
	return x.MyInt + x.MyInt
}

type Y struct {
	Age
}

type Z X
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>Interface Types Embed Interface Types</h3>

<p>
Not only can struct types embed other types, but also interface types can.
But interface types can only embed named interface types.
Please read <a href="interface.html#embedding">interfaces in Go</a> for details.
</p>

<!---

<h3>Two Types Embedding Two Types Which Denote The Same Type But Have Different Names Are Two Distinct Types</h3>

<h3>An Interesting Type Embedding Example</h3>

<div>
In the end, let's view an interesting example,
the example program will dead loop and stack overflow.
If you have understood the above content,
it is easy to understand why it will dead loop.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

type I interface {
	m()
}

type T struct {
	I
}

func main() {
	var t T
	var i = &t
	t.I = i
	i.m() // will call t.m(), then will call i.m() again, ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>
