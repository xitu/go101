<h1>Memory Leaking</h1>

<p>
When programming in a langauge supporting garbage collecting,
generally we don't need care about memory leaking problem,
for the language runtime will collect unused memory regularly.
However, we do need to be aware of some special scenarios
which may cause kind-of or real memory leaking.
The remaining of the current article will list several such scenarios.
</p>

<h3>Kind-Of Memory Leaking Casued By Substrings</h3>

<div>
<p>
Go specification doesn't specify whether or not the result string
and base string involved in a substring expression should share
the same underlying <a href="memory-block.html">memory block</a> to host
<a href="string.html">the underlying byte sequences</a> of the two strings.
The standard Go compiler/runtime does let them share the same underlying memory block.
This is a good design, which is both memroy and CPU consuming wise.
But it may cause kind-of memory leaking sometimes.
</p>

For example, after the following function <code>f</codE> is called,
there will be 1M bytes memory leaking (kind of),
until the package-level variable <code>s0</code> is modified again elsewhere.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var s0 string // a package-level variable

func f(s1 string) {
	// Assume s1 is a string much longer than 50.
	s0 = s1[:50]
	// Now, s0 shares the same underlying memory block of s1.
	// s1 is not alive now, but s0 is still alive.
	// Although there are only 50 bytes used in the block,
	// the fact that s0 is still alive prevent the 1M bytes
	// memory block from being collected.
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

To avoid this kind-of memory leaking, we can convert the substring to a
<code>[]byte</code> value then convert the <code>[]byte</code> value back
to <code>string</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f(s1 string) {
	s0 = string([]byte(s1[:50]))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The disadvantage of the above way to avoid the kind-of memory leaking
is there are two 50-byte duplications happen in the conversion process,
one of them is unecessary.
</p>

We can make using of one of <a href="string.html#conversion-optimizations">the
optimizations</a> made by the standard Go compiler to avoid one duplication,
with a small extra cost of one byte memory wasting.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f(s1 string) {
	s0 = (" " + s1[:50])[1:]
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The disadvantage of the above way is the compiler optimization may become
invalid later, and the optimization may be not available for other compilers.
</p>

The third way to avoid the kind-of memory leaking is to untilize
the <code>strings.Builder</code> supported since Go 1.10.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">import "strings"

func f(s1 string) {
	var b strings.Builder
	b.Grow(50)
	b.WriteString(s1[:50])
	s0 = b.String()
	// b.Reset() // if b is used elsewhere,
	             // it must be reset here.
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The disadvantage of the third way is a little verbose
(by comparing to the first two ways).
</p>

</div>

<h3>Kind-Of Memory Leaking Casued By Subslices</h3>

<div>
Similarly to substrings, subslices may also cause kind-of memory leaking.
In the following code, after the <code>g</code> function is called,
most memory occupied by the memory block hosting the elements of <code>s1</code>
will be lost (if no more values reference the memory block).

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var s0 []int

func g(s1 []int) {
	// Assume the length of s1 is much larger than 30.
	s0 = s1[len(s1)-30:]
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

If we want to avoid the kind-of memory leaking, we must duplicate the
30 elements for <code>s0</code>, so that the aliveness of <code>s0</code>
will not prevent the memory block hosting the elements of <code>s1</code>
from being collected.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func g(s1 []int) {
	s0 = append([]int(nil), s1[len(s1)-30:]...)
}
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>Kind-Of Memory Leaking Casued By Not Resetting Pointers In Dead Slice Elements</h3>

<div>
In the following code, after the <code>g</code> function is called,
the memroy block allocated for the first and the last elements of slice
<code>s</code> will get lost.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func h() []*int {
	s := []*int{new(int), new(int), new(int), new(int)}
	// do smething ...
	return s[1:3:3]
}
</code></pre>

<p>
If the returned slice is still alive, then it will prevent the underlying
memory block hosting the elements of <code>s</code> from being collected,
which in consequence prevents the two memory blocks allocated for the first
and the last elements of <code>s</code> from being collected,
though the two elements are dead.
</p>

If we want to avoid the kind-of memory leaking,
we must reset the pointers in the dead elements.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func h() []*int {
	s := []*int{new(int), new(int), new(int), new(int)}
	// do smething ...
	s1 := s[1:3]
	s[0] = nil; s[len(s)-1] = nil
	return s1
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
We often need to reset the pointers for some old slice elements in
<a href="container.html#slice-manipulations">slice element deletion operations</a>.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Kind-Of Memory Leaking Casued By Lost Goroutines</h3>

<div>
<p>
Some times, for some logic mistakes in code design, one or more goroutines
stay in blocking state for ever. Such goroutines are called stale goroutines.
Go runtime thinks stale goroutines are still alive.
Once a goroutine becomes stale, the resources allocated for it and the
memory blocks referenced by it will never be garbage collected.
</p>

For example, if the following function is called
by passing a nil channel argument to it,
then the current goroutine will become stale.
so the memory block allocated for <code>s</code> will never get collected.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func k(c <-chan bool) {
	s := make([]int64, 1e6)
	if <-c { // block here for ever if c is nil
		_ = s
		// use s, ...
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
If we pass a non-nil channel to the above function, and there are no other
goroutines will send values to the channel since the function is called,
The current goroutine will also become stale.
</p>

<p>
We should avoid such logic mistakes.
</p>

</div>


<h3>Finalizers</h3>

<div>
<p>
Setting a finalizer for a value which is a member of a cyclic reference group may
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#SetFinalizer">prevent all memory blocks allocated
for the cyclic reference group from being collected</a>.
This is real memory leaking, not kind of.
</p>

After the following function is called and exits,
the memory blocks allocated for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are not
guaranteed to be garbage collected in future garbage collecting.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func memoryLeaking() {
	type T struct {
		v [1<<20]int
		t *T
	}

	var finalizer = func(t *T) {
		 fmt.Println("finalizer called")
	}
	
	var x, y T
	
	// SetFinalizer will make x escape to heap.
	runtime.SetFinalizer(&x, finalizer)
	
	// Following two lines combined will make
	// x and y not collectable.
	x.t, y.t = &y, &x // y also escapes to heap.
}
</code></pre>

<p>
So, please avoid set finalizers for values in a cyclic reference group.
</p>
</div>
