<h1>Functions In Go</h1>

<p>
<a href="function-declarations-and-calls.html">Function declarations and calls</a>
have been explained before.
The current article will touch more function related concpets and details in Go.
</p>

<p>
In fact, function is one kind of first-level citizen types in Go.
In other words, we can use functions (but not including built-in functions)
as values.
Although Go is a static language, Go functions are very flexible.
The feeling of using Go functions is much like using many dynamic languages.
</p>

<p>
There are some built-in functions in Go.
These functions are declared in <code>builtin</code> and <code>unsafe</code>
standard code packages.
Built-in functions have some differences from custom declared functions.
One difference is that built-in functions support generic parameters,
but custom delcared ones don't (up to now, v1.10).
More differences will be mentioned below.
</p>

<h3>Function Signatures And Function Types</h3>

<div>

<p>
In Go, function is one kind of first-level citizen types.
The literal of a function type is composed of the <code>func</code> keyword
and a function signature literal.
A function signature is composed of two type list,
one is the input parameter type list, the other is the output result type lists.
Parameter and result names can appear in function type and signature literals,
but the names are not important.
</p>

<p>
We often use a function type literal as a function signature literal.
</p>

Here is a literal of a function type (and signature):
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (a int, b string, c string) (x int, y int, z bool)
</code></pre>

From the article <a href="function-declarations-and-calls.html">function declarations and calls</a>,
we have learned that consecutive variables with the same type can be declared together.
So the above literal is equivalent to
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (a int, b, c string) (x, y int, z bool)
</code></pre>

As parameter names and result names are not important in the literals
(as long as there are no duplicated non-blank names),
the above ones are equivalent to the following one.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (x int, y, z string) (a, b int, c bool)
</code></pre>

Variable names can be blank identifier <code>_</code>.
The above ones are equivalent to the following one.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (_ int, _, _ string) (_, _ int, _ bool)
</code></pre>

The parameter names must be either all present or all absent.
The same rule is for result names.
The above ones are equivalent to the following ones.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (int, string, string) (int, int, bool) // the standard form
func (a int, b string, c string) (int, int, bool)
func (x int, _ string, z string) (int, int, bool)
func (int, string, string) (x int, y int, z bool)
func (int, string, string) (a int, b int, _ bool)
</code></pre>

<p>
All of the above function type literals denote the same (unnamed) function type.
</p>

Each parameter list must be enclosed in a <code>()</code> in a literal,
even if the parameter list is blank.
If a result list is blank, or has only one result and
the name of the only result is absent,
then the result list doesn't need to be enclosed in a <code>()</code>.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The following three function types are identical.
func () (x int)
func () (int)
func () int

// The following two function types are identical.
func (a int, b string) ()
func (a int, b string)
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="variadic-parameter"></p>
<h4>Variadic Parameters And Variadic Function Types</h4>

<div>
The last parameter of a function can be a variadic parameter.
Each function can has most one variadic parameter.
To indicate the last parameter is variadic,
just prefix three dots <code>...</code> to its type
in its declaration. Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (values ...int64) (sum int64)
func (seperator string, tokens ...string) string
</code></pre>

<p>
A function type with variadic parameter can be called a variadic function type.
A variadic function type and a non-variadic function type are absolutely not identical.
</p>
</div>

<h4>Function Types Are Uncomprable Types</h4>

<p>
It has been <a href="type-system-overview.html#types-not-support-comparison">mentioned</a>
several times in Go 101 that function types are uncomparable types.
Generally, function values can't be compared.
But function values can be compared to the untyped bare <code>nil</code> identifier.
</p>

<p>
As function types are uncomprable types,
they can't be used as the key types of map types.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="prototype"></p>
<h3>Function Prototypes</h3>

<div>
<p>
A function prototype is composed of a function name and a function signature.
Its literal is composed of the <code>func</code> keyword,
a function name and a function signature.
</p>

A function prototype literal example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func Double(n int) (result int)
</code></pre>

<p>
In other words, a function prototype is a function declaration without
the body portion.
A function declaration is composed of a function prototype and a function body.
</p>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="variadic-function"></p>
<h3>Variadic Function Declarations And Calls</h3>

<p>
General function declarations and calls have been explained in
<a href="function-declarations-and-calls.html">function declarations and calls</a>.
Here introduces how to declare and call variadic functions.
</p>

<h4>Variadic Function Declarations</h4>

<div>
Variadic function declarations are similar to general function declarations.
Note, the variadic parameter of a variadic function will be treated as a slice
within the body of the variadic function.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// Sum and return the input numbers.
func Sum(values ...int64) (sum int64) {
	// The type of values is []int64.
	sum = 0
	for _, v := range values {
		sum += v
	}
	return
}

// An inefficient string concatenation function.
func Concat(seperator string, tokens ...string) string {
	// The type of tokens is []string.
	r := ""
	for i, t := range tokens {
		if i != 0 {
			r += seperator
		}
		r += t
	}
	return r
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Below, for a variadic parameter declared with type as <code>...T</code>,
we will say the type of the parameter is <code>[]T</code>.
</p>

In fact, the <code>Print</code>, <code>Println</code>and <code>Printf</code>
functions in the <code>fmt</code> standard package are all variadic functions.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func Print(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Printf(format string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
</code></pre>

<p>
The variadic parameter types are all <code>[]interface{}</code>.
Interface types and values will be explained <a href="interface.html">interfaces
in Go</a> later.
</p>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="variadic-call"></p>
<h4>Variadic Function Calls</h4>

<div>
There are two manners to pass arguments to a variadic parameter of type <code>[]T</code>:
<ol>
<li>
	pass a slice value as the only argument.
	The slice must be assignable to values of type <code>[]T</code>,
	and the slice must be followed by three dots <code>...</code>.
	The passed slice is called as a variadic argument.
</li>
<li>
	pass zero or more arguments which are assignable to values of type <code>T</code>.
	These arguments will be copied (or converted) as the elements of
	a new allocated slice value of type <code>[]T</code>.
	The new allocated slice will be used as the real variadic argument.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note, the two manners can't be mixed in using.
</p>

A example program which uses some variadic function calls:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func Sum(values ...int64) (sum int64) {
	sum = 0
	for _, v := range values {
		sum += v
	}
	return
}

func main() {
	a0 := Sum()
	a1 := Sum(2)
	a3 := Sum(2, 3, 5)
	// The above three lines are equivalent to
	// the following three lines.
	b0 := Sum([]int64{}...) // <=> Sum(nil...)
	b1 := Sum([]int64{2}...)
	b3 := Sum([]int64{2, 3, 5}...)
	fmt.Println(a0, a1, a3) // 0 2 10
	fmt.Println(b0, b1, b3) // 0 2 10
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Another example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func Concat(seperator string, tokens ...string) (r string) {
	for i, t := range tokens {
		if i != 0 {
			r += seperator
		}
		r += t
	}
	return
}

func main() {
	tokens := []string{"Go", "C", "Rust"}
	langsA := Concat(",", tokens...)        // manner 1
	langsB := Concat(",", "Go", "C","Rust") // manner 2
	fmt.Println(langsA == langsB)           // true
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

The following example doesn't compile,
for the two variadic function call manners are mixed.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func Sum(values ...int64) (sum int64) {
	// ...
	return
}

func Concat(seperator string, tokens ...string) (r string) {
	// ...
	return
}

func main() {
	// The following two lines both fail to compile,
	// for the same error: too many arguments in call.
	_ = Sum(2, []int64{3, 5}...)
	_ = Concat(",", "Go", []string{"C", "Rust"}...)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>
</div>

<h3>More About Function Declarations And Calls</h3>

<h4>Functions Whose Names Can Be Duplicated</h4>

<div>

Generally, the names of the functions declared in the same code package
can't be duplicated. But there are two exceptions.
<ol>
<li>
	One exception is each code package can declare several functions
	with the same name <code>init</code>.
	The prototypes of all the <code>init</code> functions
	must be <code>func init()</code>.
	Each of these <code>init</code> functions will be called
	once and only once when that code package is loaded at run time.
</li>
<li>
	The other exception is functions can be declared with names
	as the blank identifier <code>_</code>, in which cases,
	the declared functions can never be called.
</li>
</ol>
</code></pre>

</div>

<h4>Function Declarations Without Bodies</h4>

<p>
We can implement a function in <a href="https://golang.org/doc/asm">Go assembly</a>.
Generally, Go assembly source files are stored in <code>*.a</code> files.
A function implemented in Go assembly is still needed to be declared in a
<code>*.go</code> file, but the only the prototype of the function is needed
to be present. The body portion of the declaration of the function
must be omitted in the <code>*.go</code> file.
</p>

<h4>Some Functions With Results Are Not Required To Return</h4>

<div>
If a function has return results, then the last statement in its declaration
body must be a <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Terminating_statements">terminating statement</a>.
The function body is not required to contain a return statement. For example,
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func fa() int {
	a:
	goto a
}

func fb() bool {
	for{}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>
</div>

<h4>The Results Of Most Function Calls Can Be Discarded</h4>

<p>
The return results of a custom function call can be all discarded together.
The return results of calls to built-in functions, except <code>recover</code>
and <code>copy</code>, can't be discarded,
though they can be ignored by assigning them to some blank identifiers.
Function calls whose results can't be discarded can't be used as deferred
function calls or goroutine calls.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="call-as-expression"></p>
<h4>Use Function Calls As Expressions</h4>

<div>

<p>
A call to a function with single return result can always be used as a single
value. For example, it can be nested in another function call as an argument,
and can also be used as a single value to appear in any other
expressions and statements.
</p>

If the return results of a call to a multi-result function are not discarded,
then the call only can be used as a multi-valued expression in two scenarios.
<ol>
<li>
	The call can be used in an assignment as source values.
	But the call can't mix with other source values in the assignment.
</li>
<li>
	The call can be nested in another function call as arguments.
	But the call can't mix with other arguments.
</li>
</ol>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func HalfAndNegative(n int) (int, int) {
	return n/2, -n
}

func AddSub(a, b int) (int, int) {
	return a+b, a-b
}

func Dummy(values ...int) {}

func main() {
	// These lines compile okay.
	AddSub(HalfAndNegative(6))
	AddSub(AddSub(AddSub(7, 5)))
	AddSub(AddSub(HalfAndNegative(6)))
	Dummy(HalfAndNegative(6))
	_, _ = AddSub(7, 5)
	
	// These lines fail to compile.
	_, _, _ = 6, AddSub(7, 5)
	Dummy(AddSub(7, 5), 9)
	Dummy(AddSub(7, 5), HalfAndNegative(6))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Note, there are <a href="exceptions.html#nest-function-calls">exceptions</a>
to the rules of using multi-valued expression.
</p>

</div>

<h4>Some Function Calls Are Evaluated At Compile Time</h4>

<p>
Most function calls are evaluated at run time.
But calls to the functions of the <code>unsafe</code> standard package
are always evaluated at compile time.
Calls to some other built-in functions,
such as <code>len</code> and <code>cap</code>,
<a href="summaries.html#compile-time-evaluation">may be evaluated at
either compile time or run time</a>, depending on the passed arguments.
The results of the function calls evaluated at compile time can be
assigned to constants.
</p>

<h4>All Function Arguments Are Passed By Copy</h4>

<p>
Let's repeat it again, like all value assignments in Go,
all function arguments are passed by copy in Go.
When a value is copied, <a href="value-part.html#about-value-copy">only
its direct part is copied</a>.
</p>

<h3>Function Values</h3>

<div>
<p>
As above has mentioned, function types are one kind of types in Go.
A value of a function type is called a function value.
The zero values of function types are represented with
\the predeclared <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<p>
When we declare a custom function, we also declared an immutable function value in fact.
The function value is identified by the function name.
The type of the function value can represented with the literal
by omitting the function name from the function prototype literal.
</p>

<p>
Note, built-in functions can't be used as values.
<code>init</code> functions also can't be used as values.
</p>

<p>
Any function values can be invoked just like a declared function.
It is fatal error to call a nil function to start a new goroutine.
The fatal error is not recoverable and will make the whole program crash.
For other situations, calls to nil function values will produce
recoverable panics, including deferred function calls.
</p>

<p>
From the article <a href="value-part.html">value parts</a>,
we know that non-nil function values are multi-part values.
After one function value is assigned to another,
the two functions share the same undrelying parts(s).
In other words, the two functions represent the same internal function object.
The effects of invoking two functions are the same.
</p>

An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func Double(n int) int {
	return n + n
}

func Apply(n int, f func(int) int) int {
	return f(n) // the type of f is "func(int) int"
}

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", Double) // func(int) int
	// Double = nil // error: Double is immutable.

	var f func(n int) int // default value is nil.
	f = Double
	g := Apply // let compile deduce the type of g
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", g) // func(int, func(int) int) int
	
	fmt.Println(f(9))         // 18
	fmt.Println(g(6, Double)) // 12
	fmt.Println(g(6, f))      // 12
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

In practice, we often assign anonymous functtions to function variables,
so that we can call the anonymous functions multiple times.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// This function return a function (a closure).
	isMultipleOfX := func (x int) func(int) bool {
		return func(n int) bool {
			return n%x == 0
		}
	}
	
	var isMultipleOf3 = isMultipleOfX(3)
	var isMultipleOf5 = isMultipleOfX(5)
	fmt.Println(isMultipleOf3(6))  // true
	fmt.Println(isMultipleOf3(8))  // false
	fmt.Println(isMultipleOf5(10)) // true
	fmt.Println(isMultipleOf5(12)) // false
	
	isMultipleOf15 := func(n int) bool {
		return isMultipleOf3(n) && isMultipleOf5(15)
	}
	fmt.Println(isMultipleOf15(32)) // false
	fmt.Println(isMultipleOf15(60)) // true
}
</code></pre>

<p>
<p>

<p>
All functions in Go can be viewed as closures.
This is why user experiences of all kinds of Go functions are so uniform
and why Go functions are as flexible as dynamic languages.
</p>

</div>
