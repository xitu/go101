<h1>Overview Of Go Type System</h1>

<p>
This article will introduce all kinds of types in Go.
All kinds of concepts in Go type system will also be introduced.
Without knowing these concepts, it is hard to have a thorough understanding of Go.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Basic Types</h3>

<div>
Built-in basic types in Go has been introduced in
<a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html">built-in basic types
and basic value literals</a>.
For completeness of the current article, these buint-in basic types
are re-list here.
<ul>
<li>Built-in string type: <code>string</code>.</li>
<li>Built-in boolean type: <code>bool</code>.</li>
<li>Built-in numeric types:
	<ul>
	<li><code>int8</code>, <code>uint8</code> (<code>byte</code>), <code>int16</code>, <code>uint16</code>, <code>int32</code> (<code>rune</code>), <code>uint32</code>, <code>int64</code>, <code>uint64</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>uint</code>, <code>uinptr</code>.</li>
	<li><code>float32</code>, <code>float64</code>.</li>
	<li><code>complex64</code>, <code>complex128</code>.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Except <a href="string.html">string types</a>,
Go 101 article series will not try to explain more on other basic types.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Concept: Composite Types</h3>

<div>
Go supports following composite types:
<ul>
<li><a href="pointer.html">pointer types</a> - C pointer alike.</li>
<li><a href="struct.html">struct types</a> - C struct alike.</li>
<li><a href="function.html">function types</a> - functions are first-class types in Go.</li>
<li><a href="container.html">container types</a>:
	<ul>
	<li>array types - fixed-length container types.</li>
	<li>slice type - dynamic-length and dynamic-capacity container types.</li>
	<li>map types - maps are associative arrays (or dictionaries). The standard Go compiler implements maps as hashtables.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="channel.html">channel types</a> - channels are used to synchronize data among goroutines (the green threads in Go).</li>
<li><a href="interface.html">interface types</a> - interfaces play a key role in reflection and polymorphism.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
Unlike basic types, composite types may be denoted as their respective type literals.
Follwing are some literal representation examples of all kinds of composite types.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// Assume T is an arbitrary type and Tkey is
// a type supporting comparison (== and !=).

*T         // a pointer type
[5]T       // an array type
[]T        // a slice type
map[Tkey]T // a map type

// a struct type
struct {
	name string
	age  int
}

// a function type
func(int) (bool, string)

// an interface type
interface {
	Method0(string) int
	Method1() (int, bool)
}

// some channel types
chan T
chan<- T
<-chan T
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p><i>
(Below will explain <a href="#types-not-support-comparison">which types don't support comparisons</a>.)
</i></p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="type-kinds"></p>
<h3>Fact: Kinds Of Types</h3>

<p>
Each of above mentioned basic and composite types corresponds to
one kind of type. Besides these type kinds,
the type type-unsafe <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type introduced in the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/unsafe"><code>unsafe</code>
standard package</a> is also one kind of type in Go.
</p>

<p>
So, up to now (Go 1.9), Go has 26 kinds of types.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="type-definition"></p>
<h3>Syntax: Type Definitions</h3>

<p><i>
(<b>Type definition</b>, or type definition declaration,
is called <b>type declaration</b> before Go 1.9.
Since Go 1.9, type definition has become one of two kinds of type declartions
in Go.)
</i></p>

<div>
In Go, we can define new types by using the following syntaxes.
In the following example, <code>type</code> is a keyword.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// Define a solo new type.
type NewTypeName SourceType

// Define multiple new types together.
type (
	NewTypeName1 SourceType1
	NewTypeName2 SourceType2
)
</code></pre>

<p>
New type names must be identifiers.
</p>

<div>
Note,
<ul>
<li>
	a new defined type and its respective source type in type definitions
	are two distinct types.
</li>
<li>
	two different defined types are always two distinct types.
</li>
<li>
	the new defined type and the source type will share the same
	underlying type (see below for what are underlying types),
	and their values can be converted to each other.
</li>
<li>
	types can be defined within function bodies.
</li>
</ul>
</div>



<!---
Type definition can be viewed as type copying.
<ul>
<li>
	The new type will copy the value memory layout of the source type.
</li>
<li>
	If the source type is an interface type,
	the new type, also an interface type, will have the same method set as the source type.
</li>
<li>
	If the source type is a struct type,
	the new type will also copy all the fields of the source type.
</li>
<li>
	If the source type is a stuct type,
	then the new type will obtain the methods defined, either explictily or implicitly,
	for the types embedded in the source struct type.
</li>
<li>
	The new type will not obtain the methods directly defined for the source type.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The new defined type and the source type are two different types,
even if their values share the same memory layout.
In other words, the new defined type is not an alias of the source type.
</p>

-->

Some type definition examples:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The following new defined and source types are all basic types.
type (
	MyInt int
	Age   int
	Text  string
)

// The following new defined and source types are all composite types.
type IntPtr *int
type Book struct{author, title string; pages int}
type Convert func(in0 int, in1 bool)(out0 int, out1 string)
type StringArray [5]string
type StringSlice []string

func f() {
	// The three defined types can be only used within the function.
	type PersonAge map[string]int
	type MessageQueue chan string
	type Reader interface{Read([]byte) int}
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="type-alias"></p>
<h3>Syntax: Type Alias Declarations</h3>

<p><i>
(<b>Type alias declaration</b> is one new kind of type declartions added since Go 1.9.)
</i></p>

<p>
As above mentioned, there are only two built-in type aliases in Go,
<code>byte</code> (alias of <code>uint8</code>) and
<code>rune</code> (alias of <code>int32</code>).
They are the only two type aliases before Go 1.9.
</p>

<div>
Since Go 1.9, we can declare custom type alias by using the following syntaxes.
The syntax of alias declaration is much like type definition,
but please note there is a <code>=</code> in each type alias declaratio
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type (
	Name = string
	Age  = int
)

type table = map[string]int
type Table = map[Name]Age
</code></pre>

<p>
Type alias names must be identifers.
Like type definitions, type aliases can also be declared within function bodies.
<p>

<div>
By the above declarations, <code>Name</code> is an alias of <code>string</code>,
they denote the same type.
The same relation is for the other three pairs of type:
<ul>
<li>
	<code>Age</code> and <code>int</code>
</li>
<li>
	<code>table</code> and <code>map[string]int</code>
</li>
<li>
	<code>Table</code> and <code>map[Name]Age</code>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
In fact, type <code>map[string]int</code> and <code>map[Name]Age</code>
also denote the same type. So the four types involved in the last two
type alias declarations all denote the same type.
</p>

<p>
Note, although <code>table</code> and <code>Table</code> denote the same type,
<code>Table</code> is an exported type so it can be used by other packages
but <code>table</code> can't.
</p>

<!---
<p>
Type alias declarations are much useful in refactoring large Go projects.
</p>
-->
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="named-type"></p>
<h3>Concept: Named Types vs. Unnamed Types</h3>

<div>
In Go,
<ul>
<li>
	if a type has a name, which must be an identifier, and its name is not
	the blank identifier <code>_</code>, then this type is called a named type.
	All basic types are named types.</li>
</li>
<li>
	if a type can't be represented by a pure identifier,
	then the type is an unnamed type.
	The composite types denoted by their respective type literals
	in the above example are all unnamed types.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
An unnamed type must be a composite type,
It is not true vice versa,
for composite types may be defined types and alias types.
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="non-defined-type"></p>
<h3>Concept: Defined Types vs. Non-Defined Types</h3>

<p>
Before Go 1.9, there is only one kind of type declaration.
It is the current type definition.
So it is very clear that a named type must be a defined type,
and define type and named type are almost the same concept before Go 1.9.
However, since Go 1.9, things become a little complicated
by the introduction of type alias.
Now a named type may also be a type alias
and an alias type may be a defined type or not.
</p>

<p>
To make many explanations easy and clear, Go 101 adopts a new
terminology, <code>non-defined type</code>, to represent
unnamed types and alias of unnamed types.
This terminology doesn't show up in Go specification.
</p>

<p>
All basic types are defined. A non-defined type must be a composite type.
</p>

<div>
In the following example. alias type <code>C</code> and type literal
<code>[]string</code> are both non-defined types,
but type <code>A</code> and alias type <code>B</code> are both defined types.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type A []string
type B = A
type C = []string
</code></pre>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="underlying-type"></p>
<h3>Concept: Underlying Types</h3>

<div>
In Go, each type has an underlying type. Rules:
<ul>
<li>for built-in basic types, the underlying types are themselves.</li>
<li>the underlying type of <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> is itself.</li>
<li>the underlying types of an unnamed type, which must be a composite type, is itself.</li>
<li>in a type declaration, the new declared type and the source type have the same underlying type.</li>
</ul>

Examples:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The underlying types of the following ones are both int.
type (
	MyInt int
	Age   MyInt
)

// The following new types have different underlying types.
type (
	IntSlice   []int   // underlying type is []int
	MyIntSlice []MyInt // underlying type is []MyInt
	AgeSlice   []Age   // underlying type is []Age
)

// The underlying types of Ages and AgeSlice are both []Age.
type Ages AgeSlice
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
How to trace to the underlying type for a given user defined type?
The rule is, when a built-in basic type, <code>unsafe.Pointer</code>
or an unnamed type is met, the tracing will be stopped.
Take the type declarations above as examples, let's trace their underlying types.
</p>

<pre>
MyInt → int
Age → MyInt → int
IntSlice → []int
MyIntSlice → []MyInt <span style="color:#aaa">→ <strike>[]int</strike></span>
AgeSlice → []Age <span style="color:#aaa">→ <strike>[]MyInt</strike></span> <span style="color:#aaa">→ <strike>[]int</strike></span>
Ages → AgeSlice → []Age <span style="color:#aaa">→ <strike>[]MyInt</strike></span> <span style="color:#aaa">→ <strike>[]int</strike></span>
</pre>

<p>

</p>

In Go,
<ul>
<li>types whose underlying types are <code>bool</code> are called <b>boolean types</b></a>;</li>
<li>types whose underlying types are any of built-in integer types are called <b>integer types</b></a>;</li>
<li>types whose underlying types are either <code>float32</code> or <code>float64</code> are called <b>floating-point types</b></a>;</li>
<li>types whose underlying types are either <code>complex64</code> or <code>complex128</code> are called <b>complex types</b></a>;</li>
<li>integer, floating-point and complex types are also called <b>numeric types</b></a>;</li>
<li>types whose underlying types are <code>string</code> are called <b>string types</b></a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The concept of underlying type plays an important role in
<a href="value-conversions-assignments-and-comparisons.html">value conversions, assignments and comparisions in Go</a>.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Values</h3>

<p>
An instance of a type is called a value, of the type.
A type may have many values, but it has only one zero value.
Values of the same type share some common properties.
</p>

<p>
Each type has a zero value, which can be viewed as the defualt value of the type.
The predeclared <code>nil</code> identifier can used to represent as
zero values of slice, map, function, channel,
pointer (including type-unsafe pointer) and interface types.
About more on <code>nil</code>, please read <a href="nil.html">nil in Go</a> later.
</p>

<p>
There are several kinds of value representation forms in code, including
<a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html">literals</a>,
<a href="constants-and-variables.html#constant">named constants</a>,
<a href="constants-and-variables.html#variable">variables</a> and
<a href="expressions-and-statements.html">expressions</a>,
though the former three can be viewed as special cases of the latter one.
</p>

<p>
Value may be <a href="constants-and-variables.html#untyped-value">typed
or untyped</a>.
Except the predeclared <code>nil</code>,
values of composite types are all typed.
Untyped values are all basic values or the predeclared <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<p>
All kinds of basic value literals has been introduced in in the article
<a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html">basic Types and basic value literals</a>.
There are two more kinds of literals in Go, composite literals and function literals.
</p>

<p>
Function literals, as the name implies, are used to represent function values.
In fact, function literals are not unfamilar.
A <a href="function-declarations-and-calls.html#declaration">function declaration
</a> is composed of a function literal and a function identifier.
In other words, a function declaration only has one more part,
the function identifier part, than its corresponding function literal part.
Each function literal is also an annoymous function.
Function literals will be formally introduced
in the article <a href="function.html">functions in Go</a>.
</p>

<p>
Composite literals are used to represent values of struct types
and container types (arrays, slices and maps),
Please read <a href="struct.html">structs in Go</a>
and <a href="container.html">containers in Go</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
There are no literals to represent
values of pointer, channel and interface types.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="value-part"></p>
<h3>Concept: Value Parts</h3>

<p>
At run time, many values are stored somewhere in memory.
In Go, each of such values has a direct part,
however, some of them each has one or more indirect parts.
Each value part occupies a continuous memory segment.
The indirect underlying parts of a value are referenced
by its direct part through pointers.
</p>

<p>
The terminology <b>value part</b> is not defined in Go specification.
It is just used in Go 101 to make some explanations simpler
and help Go programmers understand Go types and values better.
Please read the article <a href="value-part.html">value parts</a>
for more information on value parts.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="value-size"></p>
<h3>Concept: Value Sizes</h3>

<p>
When a value is stored in memory, the number of bytes occupied
by the direct part of the value is called the size of the value.
All values of the same type have the same value size, so the size of values
of a type is often called as the size, of value size, of the type.
We can use the <code>Sizeof</code> function in the <code>unsafe</code>
standard package to get the size of any value.
</p>

<p>
Go specification doesn't specify values size requirements for non-numeric types.
The requirements for value sizes of all kinds of basic numeric types
are listed in the article
<a href="basic-types-and-value-literals.html">basic Types and basic value
literals</a>.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Dynamic Type And Dynamic Value Of An Interface Value</h3>

<p>
Interface values are the values whose types are interface types.
</p>

<p>
Each interface value can box a non-interface value in it.
The value boxed in an interface value is called the dynamic value of the interface value.
The type of the dynamic value is called the dynamic type of the interface value.
An interface value boxing nothing is a nil interface value.
</p>

<p>
For more about interface types and values,
please read <a href="interface.html">this article</a>.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Signature Of Function Types</h3>

<p>
The signature of a function type is composed of
the input parameter definition list and
the output result definition list of the function.
</p>

<p>
The function name and body are not parts of a function signature.
Parameter and result types are important for a function signature,
but parameter and result names are not important.
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="function.html">functions in Go</a> for more details
about function type and function values.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Method And Method Set Of A Type</h3>

<p>
In Go, some types can have <a href="method.html">methods</a>.
Methods can also be called member functions.
</p>

<p>
The methed set of a type is composed of all the methods of the type.
If the method set of a type is the super set of the method set
of an interface type, we say the type
<a href="interface.html#implementation">implements</a> the interface type.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Fields Of A Struct Type</h3>

<div>
A struct type is composed of a collection of member variables.
Each of the member variables is called a field of the struct type.
For example, the following struct type <code>Book</code> has
three fields, <code>author</code>, <code>title</code> and <code>pages</code>.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	author string
	title  string
	pages  int
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
For more about struct types and values,
please read <a href="struct.html">structs in Go</a>.
</p>

<p>
In Go, we can extend a type which satisfies some conditions by
<a href="type-embedding.html">embedding</a> this type in a struct type.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="pointer-base-type"></p>
<h3>Concept: Base Type Of A Pointer Type</h3>

<p>
For a pointer type, assume its underlying type can be denoted as <code>*T</code>
in literal, then <code>T</code> is called the base type of the pointer type.
</p>

<p>
For more about pointer types and values,
please read <a href="pointer.html">pointers in Go</a>.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Container Types</h3>

<p>
Array, slice and map can be viewed as formal built-in container types.
</p>

<p>
Informally, string and channel types can also be viewed as container types.
</p>

<p>
Each value of a container type has a length,
either the container type is a formal one or an informal one.
</p>

<p>
For more about container types and values,
please read <a href="container.html">containers in Go</a>.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Key Type Of A Map Type</h3>

<p>
If the underlying type of a map type can be denoted as <code>map[Tkey]T</code>,
then <code>Tkey</code> is called the key type of the map type.
<code>Tkey</code> must be a comparable type.
</p>

<h3>Concept: Key Type And Element Type Of A Container Type</h3>

<div>
The types of the elements stored in a container value must be identical.
The identicial type of the elements is called the element type of
the container type of the container value.
<ul>
<li>For an array type, if its underlying type is <code>[N]T</code>, then its element type is <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>For a slice type, if its underlying type is <code>[]T</code>, then its element type is <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>For a map type, if its underlying type is <code>map[Tkey]T</code>, then its element type is <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>For a channel type, if its underlying type is <code>chan T</code>, <code>chan&lt;- T</code> or <code>&lt;-chan T</code>, then its element type is <code>T</code>.</li>
<li>The element type of any string type is always <code>byte</code> (a.k.a. <code>uint8</code>).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Concept: Directions Of Channel Types</h3>

<div>
Channel values can be viewed as synchronized first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues.
Channel types and values have directions.
<ul>
<li>
	A channel value which is both sendable and receivable is called
	a bidirectional channel. Its type is called a bidirectional channel type.
	Bidirectional channel types are denoted as <code>chan T</code> in literal.
</li>
<li>
	A channel value which is only sendable is called
	a send-only channel. Its type is called a send-only channel type.
	Send-only channel types are denoted as <code>chan&lt;- T</code> in literal.
</li>
<li>
	A channel value which is only receivable is called
	a receive-only channel. Its type is called a receive-only channel type.
	Receive-only channel types are denoted as <code>&lt;-chan T</code> in literal.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
For more about channel types and values,
please read <a href="channel.html">channels in Go</a>.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="types-not-support-comparison"></p>
<h3>Fact: Types Which Support Or Don't Support Comparison</h3>

<div>
Currently (Go 1.9), following types don't support comparisons
(with the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators):
<ul>
<li>slice types</li>
<li>map types</li>
<li>function types</li>
<li>
any struct type with a field whose type is uncomparable
and any array type which element type is uncomparable.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Above listed types are called uncomparable types.
Compilers forbit comparing two values of uncomparable types.
</p>

<p>
All basic types, pointer types, channel types and interface types are comparable.
However, comparing two interface values may panic at run time
if both the dynamic types of them are the same uncomparable type.
</p>

<p>
Values of uncomparable types are called uncomparable values.
Some values of comprable types may also be uncomparable.
for example, an interface value whose dynamic type is an uncomparable type.
</p>

<p>
We can learn more about the detailed rules of comparisons from the article
<a href="value-conversions-assignments-and-comparisons.html#comparison-rules">value conversions,
assignments and comparisons in Go</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The key type of any map type must be a comparable type.
So the above listed types can't be used as map key types.
</p>

<h3>Fact: Object-Oriented Programming In Go</h3>

<div>
Go is not a full featured object-oriented programming language,
but Go really supports some object-oriented programming styles.
Please read the following listed articles for details:
<ul>
<li>
	<a href="method.html">methods in Go</a>.
</li>
<li>
	<a href="interface.html#implementation">implements in Go</a>.
</li>
<li>
	<a href="type-embedding.html">type embedding in Go</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Fact: Generic In Go</h3>

<p>
The generic functionalities in Go are limited to built-in types and functions.
Up to now (v1.10), Go doesn't support generic for custom types and custom functions.
Please read <a href="generic.html">built-in generic in Go</a> for details.
</p>
