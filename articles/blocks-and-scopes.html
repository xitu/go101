<h3>Code Blocks</h3>

<div>

In a Go project, there are four kinds of code blocks:
<ul>
<li>the <b>universe block</b> contains all project source code.</li>
<li>each package has a <b>package block</b> containing all source code,
	excluding the package import declarations in that package.</li>
<li>each file has a <b>file block</b> containing all the source code,
	including the package import declarations, in that file.</li>
<li>generally, a pair of braces <code>{}</code> opens and encloses a <b>local block</b>.
	The local blocks enclosed in <code>{}</code> are called explicit local blocks.
	The <code>{}</code> in composite literals and type definitions don't form
	local blocks.
</li>
</ul>

Some keywords will open some implicit code blocks.
<ul>
<li>
	the input parameters and output results of a function are viewed as being
	declared in the local block enclosed by the pair of braces
	<code>{}</code> of the function definition, even if they stay out of
	the pair of braces.
</li>
<li>
	an <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code> or <code>for</code> keyword
	will open two nested local blocks. One is implicit, the other is explicit.
	The explicit one is nested in the implicit one.
	The variables declared with short declaration forms in the simple statements closely
	following the <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code> or <code>for</code> keyword
	is declared in the implicit block.
</li>
<li>
	an <code>else</code> keyword will open one explicit or implicit block,
	which is nested in the implicit block opened by its <code>if</code> counterpart keyword.
	If the <code>else</code> keyword is followed by another <code>if</code> keyword,
	then the code block opened by the <code>else</code> keyword is implicit.
</li>
<li>
	each <code>case</code> and <code>default</code> keyword opens one implicit block,
	which is nested in the explicit block opened by its corresponding
	<code>switch</code> or <code>select</code> keyword.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The local blocks which aren't nested in any other local blocks are called top level
(or package level) local blocks.
Top level local blocks are all function bodies.
</p>
</div>


<div>
Block hierarchies:
<ul>
<li>package blocks are nested in the universe block.</li>
<li>file blocks are also directly nested in the universe block, instead of package blocks.
	(This explanation is different from Go specification and the <code>go/*</code> standard packages.)
</li>
<li>each top level local block is nested in both a package block and a file block.
	(This explanation is also different from Go specification and the <code>go/*</code> standard packages.)
</li>
<li>a non-top local block must be nested in another local block.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>
(The differences to Go specification are to make the explanation of identifier shadowing
simpler below.)
</i></p>

Here is a picture shows the block hierarchies in a program:
<div class="text-center">
	<img src="./res/blocks.png">
</div>

<p>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Code blocks are mainly used to explain scopes of declared source code element identifiers.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="declaration"></p>
<h3>Source Code Element Declaration Places</h3>

<div>
There are six kinds of source code elements which can be declared:
<ul>
<li>package imports.</li>
<li>types.</li>
<li>constants.</li>
<li>variables.</li>
<li>functions.</li>
<li>labels.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Labels are used in the <code>break</code>, <code>continue</code>, and <code>goto</code> statements.
</p>
</div>

<div>
The following table shows which code blocks all sorts of source code elements can be directly declared in:
<table class="table table-bordered text-center" style="width: auto !important;">
<thead>
	<tr>
	<th class="text-center"></th>
	<th class="text-center">the universe block</th>
	<th class="text-center">package blocks</th>
	<th class="text-center">file blocks</th>
	<th class="text-center">local blocks</th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr class="active">

</table>
</div>

<p>
<sup>(1)</sup> predeclared elements are documented in <code>builtin</code> package.
<br/>
<sup>(2)</sup> excluding struct field variables.
<br/>
<sup>(3)</sup> excluding type methods.
</p>

<div>
Please note,
<ul>
<li>
package imports will never be declared in package and local blocks.
</li>
<li>
functions can't be declared in local blocks
(anonymous functions can be enclosed in local blocks but there is no way to declare them).
</li>
<li>
labels can only be declared in local blocks.
And the intermost function block containing a label declaration
and the references of the label must be the same.
</li>
<li>
some special protions in all kinds of implicit local blocks have special requirements:
	<ul>
	<li>
	if the statement following a <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code> or <code>for</code> keyword
	is a declaration, it must be the short form of a variable declaration.
	No declarations can be contained directly in other protions of	the implicit blocks opened by these keywords.
	</li>
	<li>
	if the statement following a <code>case</code> keyword in a <code>select</code> block
	is a declaration, it must be the short form of a variable declaration.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
if the innermost containing function blocks of the two label declarations are the same one,
then the names of two labels can't be duplicated.
</li>
<li>
except labels, if the innermost containing blocks of two declared identifiers are the same one,
then the two identifiers can't be identical.
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>
(BTW, the <code>go/*</code> standard packages think file code blocks can only contain package import declarations.)
</i></p>
</div>

<p>
The source code elements declared in package blocks but outside any local blocks are called package-level source code elements.
Package-level source code elements can be constants, types, variables, or functions, but not labels and package imports.
</p>

<p>
Each package-level source code element identifier is directly contained
both in a package block and a file block.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="scope"></p>
<h3>Scopes Of Declared Source Code Elements</h3>

<div>
The scope of an declared identifier is the identifiable range of the identifier.
Here are <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Declarations_and_scope">the scope definitions</a>
for all kinds of source code element identifiers:
<ul>
<li>
	the scope of a predeclared/built-in identifier is the universe block.
</li>
<li>
	the scope of a package import identifier is the file block containing the identifier.
</li>
<li>
	the scope of an identifier denoting a constant, type, variable, or function
	(but not method) declared at package level is the package block.
	In particular, if the identifier denotes a constant or a variable,
	its scope doesn't include the line the identifier is declared at.
</li>
<li>
	the scope of an identifier denoting a method receiver, function parameter,
	or result variable is the corresponding function body (a local block).
</li>
<li>
	the scope of a constant or variable identifier declared inside a local block
	begins at the end of its declaration statement and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.
</li>
<li>
	the scope of a type identifier defined inside a local block begins at the start
	of its definition and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.
</li>
<li>
	the scope of a type alias identifier declared inside a local block begins at the end
	of its declaraion and ends at the end of the innermost containing block.
</li>
<li>
	the scope of a label is the body of the innermost function local block containing the label declaration
	but excludes all the bodies of anonymous functions nested in the containing function.
	In other words, labels can't be referenced crossing function bodies.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The elements declared with the blank identifier are not really declared and have no scopes.
</p>

<p><i>
(The predeclared <code>iota</code> is only visible in constant declarations.)
</i></p>

<div>
Yoy may have noticed the minor difference of declared identifiers between local type definitions
and local variable/constant/alias declarations. The difference means a defined type may be able to
reference itself in its definition body. Here is an example to show it more clearly:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	// var v int = v   // error: undefined: v
	// const C int = C // error: undefined: C
	/*
	type T = struct {
		*T // invalid recursive type alias T
	}
	*/
	
	// Following type definitions are all legal.
	type T struct {
		*T
	}
	type A [5]*A
	type S []S
	type M map[int]M
	type F func(F) F
	type Ch chan Ch
	type P *P
	
	// ...
	
	var s = make(S, 3)
	s[0] = s
	s = s[0][0][0][0][0][0][0][0]
	
	var m = M{}
	m[1] = m
	m = m[1][1][1][1][1][1][1][1]
	
	var p P
	p = &p
	p = ***********************p
}
</code></pre>

And the scope difference between package-level and local declarations:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

// Here the two identifiers at each line are the same one.
// They are all not the predeclcared identifiers.
/*
const iota = iota // error: constant definition loop
var true = true   // error: typechecking loop
*/

var a = b   // can reference variables declared later
var b = 123

func main() {
	// The right identifiers in the next two lines
	// are the predecalred ones.
	const iota = iota // ok
	var true = true   // ok
	_ = true
	
	// The following lines fail to compile.
	/*
	var c = d // can't reference variables declared later
	var d = 123
	_ = c
	*/
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="shadow"></p>
<h3>Identifier Shadowing</h3>

<div>
<p>
Except labels, an identifier declared in an outer code blocks can be
shadowed by the same identifier declared
in code blocks nested in the outer code block.
</p>

<p>
Labels can’t be shadowed.
</p>

<p>
If an identifier is shadowed, its scope will exclude the scopes of its shadowing identifiers.
</p>

Below is an interesting example.
The code contains 4 declared variables named <code>x</code>.
A <code>x</code> declared in a deeper block will shadow
the <code>x</code>s declared in shallower blocks.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

var p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5 *int
var x = 9999 // x#0

func main() {
	p0 = &x
	var x = 888  // x#1
	p1 = &x
	for x := 70; x < 77; x++ {  // x#2
		p2 = &x
		x := x - 70 //  // x#3
		p3 = &x
		if x := x - 3; x > 0 { // x#4
			p4 = &x
			x := -x // x#5
			p5 = &x
		}
	}
	
	fmt.Println(*p0, *p1, *p2, *p3, *p4, *p5) // 9999 888 77 6 3 -3
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

For some circumstances, when identifier shadowings meet short variable declarations,
some new gophers may get confused on whether or not a variable
in a short variable declaration is new declared.
The following example (which has bugs) shows the famous trap in Go.
Almost every gopher has ever fallen into the trap in the early days using Go.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "strconv"

func parseInt(s string) (int, error) {
	n, err := strconv.Atoi(s)
	if err != nil {
		// Some new gophers may think err is an already declared
		// variabled in the following short variable declaration.
		// However, both b and err are new declared here in fact.
		b, err := strconv.ParseBool(s)
		if err != nil {
			return 0, err
		}
		// If exection goes here, a nil error is expected to be
		// returned. But in fact, the outer non-nil error will be
		// returned. The scope of the inner "err" ends at the end
		// of the if clause.
		if b {
			n = 1
		}
	}
	return n, err
}

func main() {
	// Output: 1 strconv.Atoi: parsing "TRUE": invalid syntax
	fmt.Println(parseInt("TRUE"))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
We can use the <code>go vet -shadow</code> command to list
possible mis-shadowing uses.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="weird-shadowing"></p>

Go only has <a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html#keyword">25 keywords</a>.
Keywords can't be used as identifiers.
Many familiar words in Go are not keywords, such as <code>int</code>, <code>bool</code>,
<code>string</code>, <code>len</code>, <code>cap</code>, <code>nil</code>, etc.
They are just predeclared (built-in) identifiers.
These predeclared idenfitiers are declared in the universe block,
so custom defined identifiers can shadow them.
Here is a werid example in which many predeclared idenfitiers are shadowed.
Its compiles and runs okay.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

const len = 3      // shadows the built-in function identifier "len"
var true = 0       // shadows the built-in const identifier "true"
type nil struct {} // shadows the built-in variable identifier "nil"
func int(){}       // shadows the built-in type identifier "int"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("a weird program")
	var print = fmt.Println
	
	var fmt = [len]nil{{}, {}, {}} // shadows the package import "fmt".
	// var n = len(fmt) // sorry, "len" is a constant.
	var n = cap(fmt)    // use built-in cap function instead, :(

	// the "for" keyword will open one implicit local code block and
	// one explicit local code block.
	for true := 0; true < n; true++ {
		var false = fmt[true] // shadows the built-in const
		                      // the built-in identifier "false".
		var true = true+1 // the new declared "true" variable
		                  // shadows the iteration variable "true".
		// fmt.Println(true, false) // sorry, "fmt" is an array.
		print(true, false)
	}
}

/* output:
a weird program
1 {}
2 {}
3 {}
*/
</code></pre>

<p>
Yes, this example is extreme.
It contains many bad practices.
Identifier shadowing is useful, but please don't abuse it.
